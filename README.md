# Past-Project
It is a repository that includes my past projects related to IT.

(1) Project \
Course: Problem Solving by Programming \
This project focused on vending machines that take coins (available in Hong Kong) and provide beverages. This vending machine allowed service personnel to collect revenue and refill inventory. In this project, my task is to use C language to write a vending machine simulator that mimics its real counterpart. \
****This program can run in any C complier.** \
****Access code: 1110**
